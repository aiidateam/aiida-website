# Tutorial on high-throughput computations, June 22 to 24, 2016, EPFL (Switzerland)

A MARVEL/MaX/Psi-k "Tutorial on high-throughput computations: general methods and applications using AiiDA" will be held on June 22 to 24, 2016 at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), targeted at about 40 students, postdocs and researchers interested in applying high-throughput computations in their research and interested in learning how to use the AiiDA platform.

The program includes a tutorial on the AiiDA code, and three invited highlight talks from experts in the field of high-throughput computations:

- Gábor Csányi (University of Cambridge, UK)

- Geoffroy Hautier (Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium)

- Kristian S. Thygesen (DTU, Denmark).

Registration is open until Feb 19, 2016. The registration link, requirements that must be met by the applicants, and additional information can be found here: <http://nccr-marvel.ch/en/events/aiida-tutorial-june-2016>

Note that lodging expenses of a limited number of accepted participants will be covered with a fellowship. All other expenses (travel, food, ...) must be covered by the participants themselves. Additional participants can be accepted up to the room capacity (~40 people), but their lodging expenses will not be covered.
