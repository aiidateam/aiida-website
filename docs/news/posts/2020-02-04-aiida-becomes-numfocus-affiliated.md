# AiiDA becomes NumFOCUS affiliated project

We are excited to announce that AiiDA has joined the ranks of [NumFOCUS affiliated projects](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects) !

NumFOCUS is a public charity that promotes open practices in research, data, and scientific computing. It provides an extensive network of great open source projects in the computational science domain, and the AiiDA team is planning to participate in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) under the [NumFOCUS umbrella](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2020/ideas-list.md). We'll keep you posted!
