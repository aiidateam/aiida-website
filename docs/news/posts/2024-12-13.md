# Non research-domain specific plugins to extend core functionality

Dear users, we're happy to announce that we have recently crossed the 100-plugin mark of registered plugin packages on
the [AiiDA plugin registry](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/). Among those are classics like
[`aiida-quantumespresso`](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/) and
[`aiida-vasp`](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-vasp/), to drive the electronic structure codes we all know and love.
However, did you know that there are various non research-domain specific plugins that core developers have created
over the years, which can extend AiiDA's core functionality?

In today's post, we would therefore like to give you a short introduction to each of these plugins, and show you
how and when you can incorporate them into your work, to make sure you'll get the most out of your AiiDA journey![^1]

## Enhancing high-throughput

### [`aiida-submission-controller`](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-submission-controller/)

Have you ever wondered how a "hero run" like the one recently conducted on the new CSCS Alps infrastructure (read more
about it [here](https://nccr-marvel.ch/highlights/AiiDA-hero-run-Alps)) can be orchestrated?

### [`aiida-hyperqueue`](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-hyperqueue/)

If you've ever run simulations on a high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure, you're likely familiar with
scheduling systems, such as

## Simplifying code execution and workflow creation

## AiiDA setup

## Miscellaneous


[^1]:
    Please note that, while core developers have been using these plugins for a while to enhance their own work with
    AiiDA, many of them are still in a development, pre-stable release phase. Therefore, use them at your own risk, and
    please do provide us with your feedback so we can improve and stabilize these tools. As always, issues and PRs very
    welcome!
