# Documentation revamp, and more than 50 registered plugins

We are thrilled to announce a comprehensive revamp of the [AiiDA documentation](http://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/).

With the ultimate goal to lower the entry barrier for new users and to make it easier for both beginners and experienced AiiDA users to find the information they are looking for, the documentation is now divided into four distinct sections: a brief, learning-oriented tutorial, goal-oriented how-to recipes, understanding-oriented topic guides, and information-oriented reference material (for more details on the philosophy, see [our wiki](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki/Writing-documentation)). Your feedback is most welcome!

We are also happy to report that the [AiiDA plugin registry](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/)Â  has reached the milestone of 50 plugin packages (and 100 calculation plugins) - all thanks to your continued contribution to the AiiDA ecosystem.
