# Paper describing AiiDA’s workflow engine published

The paper describing the details of AiiDA’s workflow engine has been published today:
[M. Uhrin et al, _Workflows in AiiDA: Engineering a high-throughput, event-based engine for robust and modular computational workflows_, **Comp. Mat. Sci. 187**, 110086 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.110086)

In it you will find useful details on how the AiiDA process engine (managing calculation and workflows) works in the AiiDA 1.x series, bringing a huge speed-up with respect to earlier versions also thanks to the event-based design, leveraging the RabbitMQ message broker.

We would be grateful it users running simulations with AiiDA 1.x could cite it along with the main reference paper [S.P. Huber et al., Scientific Data 7, 300 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00638-4).
