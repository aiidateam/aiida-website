# AiiDA tutorial @ Vilnius University

An introductory tutorial to AiiDA will take place **from the 7th to the 10th of July 2020** at **[Vilnius University](https://www.vu.lt/)** (Vilnius, Lithuania).

This 3-day tutorial (from lunchtime on the 7th to lunchtime on the 10th) is designed to get about 40 students and researchers from the field of computational materials science started with writing reproducible workflows. They will be introduced by experts in the field (including the developers of the code) to the use of AiiDA, a state-of-the-art framework for provenance tracking and workflow management designed to support high-throughput research, and will gain in-depth hands-on experience using a tool that they can directly apply to their own research.

**Target Audience**: Computational scientists both from academia and from industry are encouraged to apply. Experience with python is required, but prior experience with AiiDA is not.

**Registration**: Participation in the event is free of charge, with the possibility of covering the accomodation expenses for some applicants. For more information and a link to the registration form, please visit the [official page of the event](http://www.wannier.org/events/school-2020-virtual-edition/).

**Registration deadline is the 3rd of May.**
