# AiiDA tutorial in November 2015

The [AiiDA tutorial](http://nccr-marvel.ch/en/events/aiida-tutorial-coding-days) for users and developers (followed by three coding days for plugin developers), held in Lausanne from Nov 2nd, 2015 to Nov 6th, is now ended. Thanks to all the 42 participants that have made it a big success!

This tutorial was especially targeted to the developers within the new EU H2020 MaX Centre of "Excellence on Materials Design at the

Exascale", and to the [NCCR MARVEL](http://nccr-marvel.ch/) community.
