# SciPy2022 talk: AiiDA common workflows for computing material properties using different quantum engines

On Wednesday, July 13th, we will be giving a talk about the [AiiDA common workflows](https://aiida-common-workflows.readthedocs.io/) project at the [SciPy, Austin TX conference](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/update-conference-schedule).

This talk will feature an overview of the AiiDA common workflows project, an international collaboration to develop a standardized, open source, interface for computing material properties across many quantum simulation codes.
The workflows are underpinned by AiiDA, a Python based framework for developing and running scientific workflows.
