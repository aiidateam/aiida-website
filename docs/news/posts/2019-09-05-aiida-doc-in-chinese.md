# AiiDA documentation available in Chinese

Thanks to tireless volunteer efforts by **Jusong Yu of South China University of Technology** and **Jianxing Huang, Yunpei Liu and Jinfang Xiong of Xiamen University**, the aiida-core documentation [is now available in Chinese](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/zh_CN/latest/).

With about 50% of all strings translated, most introductory sections are fully covered, with more to come before the AiiDA 1.0 release in the next weeks.

For more information, and instructions on how to contribute to the localization in Chinese (or other languages), see [here](https://github.com/unkcpz/aiida-l10n-zh_CN).
