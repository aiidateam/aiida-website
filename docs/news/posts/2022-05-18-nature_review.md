# AiiDA features in Nature Reviews Physics “Tools of the Trade”

To mark the release of AiiDA v2.0, it was presented as a [“Tool of the Trade” in Nature Reviews Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-022-00463-1). It gives a high-level overview of the developments in AiiDA itself, but also provides an insight in the ever growing ecosystem surrounding it. The plugin registry shows the activity of the user community that is starting to include industry as well as academia. This community is what makes collaborative projects, such as the [AiiDA common workflows](https://aiida-common-workflowsd.readthedocs.io) for example, possible.
