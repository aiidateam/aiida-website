# Swiss consortium wins funding to establish ORD practices leveraging AiiDA and openBIS

A consortium led by Dr. Giovanni Pizzi (project leader of [NCCR MARVEL's Pillar 3, "Digital Infrastructure of Open Simulations and Data,"](https://nccr-marvel.ch/research/iii/projects/open-digital-infrastructure) and Group leader of the ["Materials Software and Data" group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lms/msd-group) at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI), including also researchers from Empa and ETH Zurich, has won funding of almost CHF1.3 million for a 3-year project funded under the ["ORD-R Establish" initiative of the ETH Board](https://ethrat.ch/en/measure-1-calls-for-field-specific-actions/).

## About the project
The project, dubbed PREMISE, aims to establish, promote and facilitate the adoption of Open Research Data (ORD) practices that adhere to FAIR data principles in the field of materials science. It will provide missing critical components to enable open and reproducible research, focusing in particular on the interoperability of data from simulations and experiments.
During their project, the researchers will draw on the existing platforms [openBIS](https://openbis.ch/), an open-source data management platform developed at ETH Zurich, and [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net), an open-source workflow management system mainly developed at PSI and EPFL. The two platforms focus on different parts of the data life cycleâ€”experiments and simulations, respectively.
