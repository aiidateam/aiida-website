# AiiDA v2.4.0 released

We are pleased to announce that AiiDA v2.4 was just released [^1].
It can be installed as always from PyPI using pip:

    pip install aiida-core==2.4

or using Conda instead:

    conda install aiida-core=2.4

This release includes a number of interesting features and bug fixes.
As a result of one of the bug fixes, related to the caching of CalcJob nodes, a database migration had to be added, the first since the release of v2.0.
After ugrading to v2.4.0, you will be prompted to migrate your database.
The automated migration drops the hashes of existing CalcJobNodes and provides you with the optional command to recompute them.
Execute the command if existing CalcJobNodes need to be usable as valid cache sources.

For a complete overview, please refer to the change log [^2].

Happy computing!

The AiiDA team
