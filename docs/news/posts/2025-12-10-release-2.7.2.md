# AiiDA v2.7.2 released

We just released a new version of AiiDA, v2.7.2.

This patch release comes with a number of important bug fixes to the CLI, storage, archive, and transport modules, so we strongly recommend upgrading from prior 2.7.x versions.
You can find a list of all the fixes included in the [CHANGELOG](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.7.2/reference/_changelog.html#v2-7-2-2025-12-10).

With this, the next target will be the v2.8.0 release which will include the new features we’ve recently been working on.
There’s already a GitHub project [here](https://github.com/orgs/aiidateam/projects/18/views/1), if you want to stay in the loop.

Happy computing!

The AiiDA team
