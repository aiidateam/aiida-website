# AiiDA moves from BitBucket to GitHub

The AiiDA code has moved as of today from BitBucket, that has hosted the source since its infancy, to GitHub.

While this move might seem inconvenient for users, we felt that the advantages of moving to GitHub were sufficiently important to justify the move.

More details can be found [in this post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/aiidausers/6MJSF5WNz7s). Please note that from now on, all issues and pull requests should be added on GitHub only.
