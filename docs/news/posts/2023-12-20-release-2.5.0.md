# AiiDA v2.5.0 released

We are pleased to announce that AiiDA v2.5 was just released [^1].
It can be installed as always from PyPI using pip:

    pip install aiida-core==2.5

or using Conda instead:

    conda install aiida-core=2.5

This release includes a number of interesting features and bug fixes.
For example, new storage backends are added that make it easy to setup profiles without a PostgreSQL server; ideal for testing and demonstration purposes.
For a complete overview, please refer to the change log [^2].

Happy computing!

The AiiDA team
