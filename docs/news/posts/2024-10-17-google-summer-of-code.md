# AiiDA at Google Summer of Code 2024

We are proud to announce that AiiDA has successfully participated in the Google Summer of Code program this year (under the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) organization umbrella).
Our student [Sharan Poojari](https://github.com/SharanRP) built a prototype for a [next-generation web-based AiiDA provenance explorer](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-explorer).
