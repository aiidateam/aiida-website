# Two 4-year postdoctoral positions (Marzari@EPFL)

There are two positions for computational materials scientist/software scientists immediately available in our laboratory for Theory and Simulation of Materials at EPFL. The two positions, for up to 4 years each, are dedicated to data analytics, data integration, and simulation/machine-learning workflows, and are supported by the new H2020 projects DOME4.0 and OpenModel.

The DOME4.0 position is centered around the successful execution of research case studies in combination with the existing Materials Cloud platform ([https:/www.materialscloud.org](https://www.materialscloud.org)), with a primary focus on the development of machine-learning-based data analytics workflows and auxiliary data services. Successful candidates will develop tools and services required to support their own research aims and those of project partners. Potential scientific projects include the efficient identification of next-generation Li-Ion batteries, machine learning of materials properties from structure and electronic structure, or similar suitable projects.

The OpenModel position is centered around the development of software services to create and execute computational materials science workflows, with a primary focus on the integration of semantic universal data structures and ontology development. Successful candidates would develop tools and services required to support their own research aims and those of project partners. Potential scientific projects include the development and integration of domain ontologies, machine-learning-driven decision-making on models and methods for workflow builders, or similar suitable projects.

Close synergies are envisioned with the Swiss National Centre for Computational Design and Discovery of Novel Materials (NCCR MARVEL), the H2020 MaX Centre of Excellence for Materials Design at the Exascale, the H2020 Materials Modelling MarketPlace, H2020 Intersect and H2020 BIG-MAP Battery2030+, and with the AiiDA and Materials Cloud teams onsite.

Interested candidates should apply by Nov 6, following the instructions at [http://theossrv1.epfl.ch/Main/Openings](http://theossrv1.epfl.ch/Main/Openings) for the two separate openings; the website has also more information on the group. The positions will remain open until filled (the ads will then be removed from the link above). Each position is fully funded for 4 years; the contract is initially for 1 year (as required by EPFL), and renewable yearly upon mutual satisfaction. Gross salaries for a freshly minted Ph.D. start at 83’600 CHF/year (~77’500 EUR/year); social benefits (unemployment, pension) are also provided.
