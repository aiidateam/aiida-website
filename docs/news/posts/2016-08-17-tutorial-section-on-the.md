# Tutorial Section on the AiiDA webpage now available!

We have added a Tutorials section to the AiiDA webpage: <https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io>.

You can already download the first plug-and-play tutorial of June-July 2016! (mainly based on Quantum ESPRESSO as the computational engine)

In the future, we will distribute in the same section the updated AiiDA tutorials (for new releases, new tutorial events, ...).

We have done our best to make your user experience free of any setup issues: you will just need to setup VirtualBox on your machine following our instructions, and download the image we provide. Start learning immediately how AiiDA can boost your research!
