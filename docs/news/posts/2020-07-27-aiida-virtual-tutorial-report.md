# AiiDA virtual tutorial report

A few weeks ago we organised the first virtual edition of our AiiDA tutorial week. Arranging a tutorial for 13 different time zones was challenging, but it was a great experience and we received a lot of positive feedback on the virtual format by the participants. You can read the full report here:

In case you missed the tutorial, you can find all the presentations and hands-on material on the webpage of the event:

Thanks again to the participants for attending! We look forward to organising more virtual events in the future.
