# AiiDA at Google Summer of Code 2020

Thanks to the folks at [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), AiiDA is participating in the Google Summer of Code 2020 [under the NumFOCUS umbrella](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4727917315096576/) for the first time.

March 5th - Call for participation 
-----------------------------------

In short, this means that students (at the BSc/MSc or Ph.D. level, see [eligibility criteria](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)) can apply to work on an [interesting AiiDA coding project](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki/GSoC-2020-Projects) for 3 months during the summer (May 18th-August 10th) and get reimbursed for their work.

Applications officially start **March 16th**, but selection will be competitive, and we recommend

*   reading the [pertinent advice](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-students.md) by NumFOCUS,
*   looking through our [project ideas](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki/GSoC-2020-Projects),
*   and reaching out early.

Looking forward to your applications! We'll keep updating this post as we move along. The AiiDA Team P.S. We are committed to help fight the [insane gender imbalance in the open source community](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) - that is to say: women are particularly encouraged to apply.
