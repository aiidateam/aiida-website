# AiiDA Hackathon: developing code plugins and robust scientific workflows @ Cineca, Bologna, Italy

The hackathon will take place from February 17  to 21 at [Cineca](https://www.cineca.it): [Via Magnanelli, 6/3, 40033 Casalecchio di Reno, Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/B9U2rzavLHXoK1UH9).

Participating AiiDA plugin developers will be shown best practices and useful tips on:

* code development practices (automated testing, continuous integration, code style checks, packaging, distribution)

* writing reusable, robust and modular workflows

* taking full advantage of the AiiDA v1.0 API

In addition, during the event we will discuss and define common APIs for workflows for the computation of materials' properties.

When adopted by plugin developers, these common APIs enable AiiDA users to compute a material's property using different codes without the need to know the interface of each plugin in detail.

**Program**

* The workshop will start on February 17th at 15:00 and will finish on February 21st at 12:00

* Welcome and registration on 17th will be open from 14:30

* The current tentative program can be found on [the PRACE website](https://events.prace-ri.eu/event/957/attachments/1116/1817/AiiDA_CINECA_hackathon_preliminary_agenda.pdf)
