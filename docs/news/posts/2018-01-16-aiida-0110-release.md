# New AiiDA release 0.11.0

A new AiiDA release v0.11.0 is available! You can find more information at our [download page](/sections/download.md)!

Amongst other improvements, this release adds simple-to-use test decorators for writing tests of AiiDA plugins. Plugins can now add custom commands to the `verdi data` command line interface

Important things to note:

* The `async` method of `aiida.work.run` module has been removed because it could lead to race conditions causing database inconsistencies. Simply replace any call to `async` in your code with `submit` that is also located in the `aiida.work.run` module
* The `plugin-cmd` branch has been deleted from `aiidateam/aiida_core`. The functionality that it had, has been merged into the release v0.11.0

A detailed overview of a all the changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/blob/v0.11.1/CHANGELOG.md)
