# Interested in a summer project working on AiiDA?

After a successful Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020 under the [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/) umbrella, the AiiDA team plans to participate in [GSOC 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) as well. Last year's GSOC student @unkcpz [set the bar pretty high](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5283081100984320/), but don't be shy - there is [lots more to do](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki/GSoC-2021-Projects)!

Google Summer of Code is a way for you to get a summer job getting to know an open source project in depth and moving it forward. Different from previous years, GSOC 2021 projects will be 175 hours during the period from June 7th until August 16th 2021. This makes it possible to participate part-time (e.g. 18h/week for 10 weeks) or in a shorter full-time stint.

Just as a reminder, here is an excerpt from the [GSOC 2021 timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works):

* Student Application Period March 29, 2021 - April 13, 2021

Students can register and submit their applications to mentor organizations.

* Student Projects Announced May 17, 2021

Accepted students are paired with a mentor and start planning their projects and milestones.

If you're interested in working on aiida-core as a student, please say hi in the [dedicated discussion thread](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/discussions/4702) and ask any questions you may have.
