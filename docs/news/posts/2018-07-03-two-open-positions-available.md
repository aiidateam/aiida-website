Two positions for computational materials scientists/software scientists are available at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland) in the group of Prof. Nicola Marzari. The positions are funded by the new [H2020 MarketPlace project](https://www.the-marketplace-project.eu/) (2018-2022, 9.2 M€) aimed at developing a single entry point for all industrial and academic materials modeling activities in Europe. EPFL will lead the work package on "Data and Modeling Services".
