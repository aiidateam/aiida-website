# AiiDA virtual tutorial registration now open

The AiiDA team are pleased to announce that registration for our upcoming virtual tutorial (July 5-9 2020) is now open until **June 10th**.

As it was the case of last year, this tutorial week will be hosted virtually. Talks will be pre-recorded and made available to participants before the event, and hands-on tutorials will be held *via* [Zoom](https://zoom.us) at two timeslots, to accommodate for participants in different time-zones.

The goal of this 5 day-tutorial is to help students and researchers from the field of computational materials science get started with writing reproducible workflows. Participation is free of charge and will cater for up to 120 participants.

**For further information and the tentative schedule, and to register, please see the official [event page](./2020-06-04-aiida-tutorial-event.md).**
