# 2 post-doc/software engineer positions on AiiDA at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI (Switzerland)

Two new post-doc opportunities (post-doc/software engineers) are open in the [Materials Software and Data Group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lms/msd-group), part of the Laboratory for Materials Simulations, in the [Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)](https://www.psi.ch/en), Switzerland.

Candidates will contribute to the development of the AiiDA workflow engine, focusing on supporting large data scales and next-generation High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures. The selected candidates will work under the supervision of Dr. Giovanni Pizzi and will be fully integrated into the core development team of AiiDA.

These positions are funded under the SwissTwins project, offering close collaboration with project partners such as the Swiss Supercomputer Center CSCS, EPFL, and ETHZ, among others. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to engage in collaborative projects across Switzerland and Europe, expanding your network of international collaborations.
Upon interest, research topics can be integrated in the job, e.g. expanding the research on the high-throughput materials databases developed in the group.

We are seeking candidates with a PhD degree in the physical sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, or materials science/engineering) and a strong passion for programming. Essential qualifications include experience in running simulations on HPC and proficient software development and Python programming skills. Desirable skills include familiarity with Python backend development, HPC simulation software, managing software projects in a team, and handling large amounts of data.
