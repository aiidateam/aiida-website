# New plugins released (SSH, SLURM, SGE)

This is to announce that we have released a number of plugins for the aiida\_core package: **a SSH plugin for connections to remote clusters with SSH+SFTP and scheduler plugins for SLURM and SGE**.

These plugins, already available within the aiida\_epfl package (restricted to academic users), are now in aiida\_core and free to use and redistribute under the term of the MIT licence.

The new plugins can be obtained from the AiiDA GIT repository on BitBucket (develop branch), and will be part of the next stable release of AiiDA.

As a side note, we underline that this release follows our broader plans: for developments at EPFL, we develop and test within aiida\_epfl, and when ready we push these developments to aiida\_core. In the upcoming months we will release other plugins for data nodes and simulation codes.
