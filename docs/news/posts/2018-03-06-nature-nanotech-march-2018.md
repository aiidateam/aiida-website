# Nature Nanotechnology March cover features a high-throughput study on novel 2D materials performed using AiiDA

The [March 2018 issue of Nature Nanotechnology](https://www.nature.com/nnano/volumes/13/issues/3) features a paper by N. Mounet and coworkers who have used AiiDA to identify  close to 2000 well-known inorganic compounds that may be exfoliated into novel 2D materials and compute, for a large subset of over 250 of them, their electronic, vibrational, magnetic and topological properties.

The paper has been also highlighted in a few feature stories, including the homepage of the [EPFL website](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/a-treasure-trove-for-nanotechnology-experts/) and on the [MARVEL website](http://nccr-marvel.ch/highlights/2018-03-2d-or-not-2d).
