# New AiiDA release 0.12.0

A new AiiDA release v0.11.4 is available! You can find more information at our [download page](/sections/download.md)!

This is a minor release with various bug fixes, improvements and the implementation of a caching mechanism. This mechanism allows AiiDA to skip calculations that have already been successfully completed before, for example when rerunning a workchain that crashed at a late stage. With this feature, especially during plugin development, a lot of valuable computer time can be saved. For more details on this new powerful feature of AiiDA, please refer to the [documentation](http://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/v0.12.0/caching/index.html).

A detailed overview of a all the changes can be found in the change log on [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/blob/v0.12.0/CHANGELOG.md)
