# Paper published: A Terminology for Scientific Workflow Systems

We're excited to announce the publication of our recent [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X25002699) titled "A Terminology for Scientific Workflow Systems" to the journal "Future Generation Computer Systems".

This work represents a joint effort by workflow developers and practitioners from the [Workflows Community Initiative](https://workflows.community), who came together to address a recurring challenge: with hundreds of existing workflow management systems (WMSs), how can researchers compare them meaningfully and choose the right one for their needs?

In the paper, a flexible and descriptive terminology to characterize WMSs across five key axes is introduced:

1. Workflow characteristics
1. Composition
1. Orchestration
1. Data management
1. Metadata capture

Each axis defines terms to describe high-level features, like how workflows are structured (e.g. task- vs data-driven), how they are composed (e.g. schema, API, GUI), how tasks are orchestrated, how data is moved and stored, and how execution metadata is captured and used.

As a demonstration, 23 widely used WMSs are classified, including (but not limited to) AiiDA, Nextflow, Snakemake, and Pegasus, using this shared vocabulary.
We hope the terminology developed in this work becomes a shared reference for developers and users alike, and we invite the broader community to adopt and contribute to its future evolution.

Happy computing!
