# Feedback form

In order to make it easy for AiiDA users to give feedback and suggestions on the code to the developers, we have opened a [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/u0yhDQ39IoRQeFg42).

We encourage any user to leave there comments, feedback on usability, unclear documentation, or anything else that they want to tell the developers.

We need your feedback to know what is more important for you, and what we can improve!
