# AiiDA tightly integrated with the new Microsoft Azure Quantum Elements platform

Microsoft recently launched their new [Azure Quantum Elements](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/our-story/quantum-elements-overview) platform. We are happy to share that AiiDA is tightly integrated in it!

You can check out for instance the [launch video](https://news.microsoft.com/azure-quantum-june-event) introduced by Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella (check e.g. from minute 13:00, where AiiDA workflows are used to drive workflows).

If you are interested, you can also check out the [Microsoft webinar](https://connect.discoveracs.org/CENWebinar_Microsoft_6_22_23?partnerref=Microsoft) today at 5PM CEST, where they discuss their Azure Quantum platform to accelerate scientific discovery, and the interaction with AiiDA is also highlighted.
