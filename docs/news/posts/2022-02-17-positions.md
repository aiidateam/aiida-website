# Open positions: BIG-MAP and MARVEL Postdocs/Software Engineers

Two open positions for postdocs/software engineers are available at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), under the supervision of Prof. Nicola Marzari and Dr. Giovanni Pizzi. The positions are renewable yearly up to 4 years.

Outstanding candidates are sought with a background in the physical sciences, with strong programming skills, and with experience in scientific software development and running materials simulations in high performance computing systems.

The positions will focus working on the coupling of the Materials Cloud Archive repository with automatic simulation capabilities, powered by AiiDA and made available as easy-to-use graphical apps in the AiiDAlab portal.

The candidates will work together with a team of 10+ PhD students, postdocs, and software specialists with diverse backgrounds contributing to AiiDA, Materials Cloud and AiiDAlab, joining an exciting and very driven international team at the forefront of research in the field of materials discovery and design.

For interested applicants, scientific research challenges can also be incorporated in the effort (but this is not a requirement).

For best consideration, applications should be submitted by March 20th, 2022; the positions will remain open until suitable candidates have been found.
