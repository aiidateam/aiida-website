# AiiDA tutorial at Vilnius University (Vilnius, Lithuania)

## Description

This 3-day tutorial is designed to get about 40 students and researchers from the field of computational materials science started with writing reproducible workflows. Participation both from academia and from industry is encouraged.

Participants will be introduced by experts in the field to the use of AiiDA, a state-of-the-art framework for provenance tracking and workflow management designed to support high-throughput research, and will gain in-depth hands-on experience using a tool that they can directly apply to their own research.

The AiiDA framework is a tool for workflow management and provenance tracking, which is backed by a significant community of users and developers, and has interfaces to more than 20 materials science codes (see [plugin registry](http://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry)), including (among others) to the ab initio codes Quantum ESPRESSO, VASP, cp2k, Castep, Siesta, Fleur, Crystal, NWChem, Wannier90, and Yambo. AiiDA's permissive open source license (MIT) enables participants to use it both in academic and commercial settings. By virtue of its general design and flexible plugin system, AiiDA is easily extended to new codes and new use cases.

In order to avoid losing time on installation issues, participants will have the option to connect to virtual machines preconfigured with AiiDA (or to come with AiiDA already installed on their laptop via the [Quantum Mobile virtual machine](https://quantum-mobile.readthedocs.io/en/latest)).

The event will mostly focus on in-depth tutorials on using AiiDA and on writing workflows. It will also include some talks on how AiiDA has been already used in production, given by the organisers and the core developers of AiiDA; on advanced aspects of workflow management; on designing and writing new AiiDA plugins; and on research data management (RDM) and how to write data management plans (DMPs), especially when using AiiDA and the [Materials Cloud](https://www.materialscloud.org).
