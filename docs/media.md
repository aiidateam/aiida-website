AiiDA is a comprehensive, open-source, community-driven workflow manager for high-throughput calculations with roots in computational materials science. We demonstrate how AiiDA, implemented in Python, facilitates the implementation of complex simulation pipelines and makes them fully reproducible through automatic tracking of data provenance. We discuss the progress made over the past four years that has enabled managing tens of millions of HPC simulations scaling on thousands of computational nodes. We conclude with an overview of the AiiDA community building efforts, including the extensive plugin ecosystem, the AiiDA lab portal for sharing turn-key solutions, and the Materials Cloud open science web platform for FAIR data sharing.
