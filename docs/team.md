## Credits

AiiDA is a joint effort of [THEOS](http://theossrv1.epfl.ch/)/[MARVEL](https://nccr-marvel.ch/) at EPFL (Switzerland) and of [Bosch RTC](https://www.bosch.us/) in Cambridge MA (USA). Its development is supported by [a number of supporting partners and institutions](more/acknowledgements.md).
Data generated with AiiDA are disseminated through [materialscloud.org](http://materialscloud.org/).

## External contributors

Besides the AiiDA team at EPFL listed below, we thank our [numerous external code contributors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/develop/AUTHORS.txt) as well as [all plugin developers](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/) for making the AiiDA ecosystem what it is today.
