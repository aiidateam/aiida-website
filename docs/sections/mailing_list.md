# Discourse

The main communication platform for AiiDA is the [Discourse server](https://aiida.discourse.group).
It is mostly designed to be used as a traditional discussion forum, but it can also be used to function as a mailing list.
See [this post](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-do-i-use-discourse-via-email/15279) for details on how to configure it as such.


# Legacy Google group

Below is the information of the legacy Google mailing list that was active until September 2023.
It has since been replaced by a [Discourse server](https://aiida.discourse.group).

## Mailing list

AiiDA provides a [fully archived](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/aiidausers) mailing list for general announcements and questions related to AiiDA. Only subscribed users can post new topics.

### How to subscribe

To subscribe

- visit [http://groups.google.com/group/aiidausers/subscribe](http://groups.google.com/group/aiidausers/subscribe)
  Traffic is quite low, so you may want to select”Notify for every new message” as ’email delivery preference’ in the pop-up window.
