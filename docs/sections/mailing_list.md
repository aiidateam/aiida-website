# Support

If you require support, or want to discuss anything surrounding AiiDA and its use, please feel free to post on the [Discourse server](https://aiida.discourse.group).
The Discourse platform is mostly designed to be used as a traditional discussion forum, but it can also be used to function as a mailing list.
See [this post](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-do-i-use-discourse-via-email/15279) for details on how to configure it as such.


## Legacy Google group

The legacy [Google mailing](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/aiidausers) is fully archived on September 2023.
It has since been replaced by a [Discourse server](https://aiida.discourse.group).
