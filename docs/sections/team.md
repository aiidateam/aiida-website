# Team

## Credits

AiiDA is a joint effort of the [Materials Software and Data group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lms/msd-group) (part of the [LMS](https://www.psi.ch/en/lms) laboratory at [PSI](https://www.psi.ch/), Switzerland), [THEOS](http://theossrv1.epfl.ch/) laboratory at EPFL (Switzerland), and [Bosch RTC](https://www.bosch.us/) in Cambridge MA (USA). Its development is supported by [NCCR MARVEL](https://nccr-marvel.ch/) and [a number of additional supporting partners and institutions](acknowledgements.md).
Data generated with AiiDA are disseminated through [materialscloud.org](http://materialscloud.org/).

## External contributors

Besides the AiiDA development team listed below, we thank our [numerous external code contributors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/develop/AUTHORS.txt) as well as [all plugin developers](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/) for making the AiiDA ecosystem what it is today.
